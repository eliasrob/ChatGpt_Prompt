We will need a build tool to build the client\front-end of our project, its called vite
Which needs to use npm.
Run the following code:

Npm create vite@latest --template vanilla

cd into client and run : npm install
Now create a server folder and cd into it
 Run this line to create a package.json file inside of our server 
$ npm init -y
Npm install cors used for cross origin requests (server\client)
Npm install dotenv used for secure environment variables
Npm install express as a backend framework
Npm install nodemon to keep our application running during changes
Npm install openai - for our chatgpt example

Npm install cors dotenv express nodemon openai

Then write the server side code in server.js
navigat to server folder and in terminal ruin :
    npm init -y
    which will create a new package.json file
in package.json add this line:
     "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "server": "nodemon server"
  },

  and add this line if you plan to import rather than require modules:
  "description": "",
  this here is the addition =   "type": "module",
  "main": "server.js",

to run client:
    npm run dev
to run server:
    npm run server
