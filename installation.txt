We will need a build tool to build the client\front-end of our project, its called vite
Which needs to use npm.
Run the following code:

Npm create vite@latest --template vanilla

cd into client and run : npm install
Now create a server folder and cd into it
 Run this line to create a package.json file inside of our server 
$ npm init -y
Npm install cors used for cross origin requests (server\client)
Npm install dotenv used for secure environment variables
Npm install express as a backend framework
Npm install nodemon to keep our application running during changes
Npm install openai - for our chatgpt example

Npm install cors dotenv express nodemon openai

Then write the server side code in server.js

in package.json add this line:
     "start": "node server.js"

to run client:
    npm run dev
to run server:
    npm run server
